You must have the experience narrowing your eyes for the better sights. Do you think it is thoughtful and romantic if the content on the web page will be magnified automatically when you shrink your eyes? That is what we want to do.\r\n# \r\nThe purpose of our project aims to assist people in having better Sights with Eyetracker when they are reading web pages. We plan to integrate this function directly into a browser. Therefore, the steps for this project is shown as follows:\r\n    1. detect the movement of people's eyes with eye tracker;\r\n    2. detect and analyzing the shape of eyelids to see if the eyes are narrowed;\r\n    3. use eyes instead of hands to control the computer;\r\n    4. Magnifying the content on the web pages if there is a signal showing people are narrowing their eyes.\r\n\r\n### **Team Members**\r\n* CSE 218:​Xiaoying Gao & Ziyan Zhu\r\n* CSE 118:​Benjamin Du, Daniel Gou, Arturo Aguilar & Alexander Luong ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
